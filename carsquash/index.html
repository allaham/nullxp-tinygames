    <p style="width:36em;margin-top:1em;">Car Squash is for those of us who like to go hiking in the countryside, but have the nature experience spoiled by the noise & fugliness of motorways. Disclaimer: I drive just like the rest of us, and this game is not intended to incite any form of violence towards cars and drivers. The idea is to add cyclists or cute animals for which you would lose points, and perhaps 'shoo' the cars away instead of squashing them in future versions.</p>
